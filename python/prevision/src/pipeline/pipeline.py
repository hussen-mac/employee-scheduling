class Pipeline:
    """
    Represents a pipeline that processes data through a sequence of stages.

    This class defines a pipeline that can be executed with a set of stages, each stage performing
    a specific operation on the data.

    Attributes:
        stages (list): A list of stages to be executed in the pipeline.

    Methods:
        __init__(stages):
            Initializes the pipeline with the provided stages.
        run(df=None):
            Executes the pipeline on the provided DataFrame.

    def __init__(self, stages):
        """
        Initializes the Pipeline with the provided stages.

        Args:
            stages (list): A list of stages to be included in the pipeline. Each stage should be
                an object that defines a `process` method for data transformation.

        Returns:
            None: This method does not return any value. It sets up the pipeline with the specified stages.

        Executes the pipeline on the provided DataFrame.

        This method is a placeholder and should be overridden in subclasses to implement

        Args:
            df (pd.DataFrame, optional): The DataFrame to be processed by the pipeline. If no DataFrame
                is provided, the method will use the default behavior defined in subclasses.
